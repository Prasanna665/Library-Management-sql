The Library Management System is a structured relational database schema designed to support the core functionalities of a library. It handles user authentication, book management, author and publisher tracking, staff scheduling, member (reader) management, book issuing, fine tracking, and system configurations. This schema uses PostgreSQL and is encapsulated within the library_management schema.
